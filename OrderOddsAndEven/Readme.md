Simple Algorithm to order an array of numbers

Rule
Even numbers must come first and must precede odd numbers that must be ordered in descending order

Example:

Input: [1,2,-5,4,7,2,4,7,-10,23,77,123,5,13,8,12,5,5,5,3,1,3,5,8,1,2,3,4,8,4,7,5,8,10,25]

Output: [-10, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10, 12, 123, 77, 25, 23, 13, 7, 7, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, -5]
